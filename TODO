====

- Top-level function rules

- STABLE SYNTAX!!!
- Smarty compat for foreach syntax (maybe with a special
  flag for enabling?  ick)

1.2
===

- ???

2.0
===

- remove deprecated features
- generate cacheable bytecode (if PHP allows it by then)
  may need compilation to PHP, but only if we don't have to
	keep the file around (because Smarty does this and it
	breaks far, far too easily)
