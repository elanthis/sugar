Sugar is a new template engine, inspired by the author's experience
with the Smarty template engine.  Sugar aims to provide a simple
but flexible API, a friendly and easy macro language, and intelligent
and easy caching functionality.

The engine is implemented as a mini-scripting language parser and
runtime, allowing for both quite flexible language features and for
powerful expressions that a regular-expression engine like Smarty is
not capable of providing.

The Sugar documentation can found in the doc/ directory.
